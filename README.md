In this project, I trained machine learning and deep learning models to predict the percentage of Silica concentrate in the Iron ore concentrate per minute. This could be applied practically in the mining industry to get the percentage Silica concentrate at much faster and accuracy rate compared to traditional methods.
By leveraging data science, AI has helped the mining facilities to sustain a faster production pace with an improved efficiency level.
Efficiency has bee improved by performing operational tweaks to boost output.
In this project, it was discovered that Silica production could be increased if the mill was fed with more Ore per minute.
